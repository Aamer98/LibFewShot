# Introduction
`LibFewShot` is a comprehensive library for few-shot learning (FSL), especially for few-shot image classification. It integrates multiple classic FSL methods into a unified framework, including four fine-tuning based methods, six meta-learning based methods, and eight metric-learning based methods. This library is friendly for beginners in few-shot learning with very concise code and clear structure.
